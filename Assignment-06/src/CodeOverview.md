## Overview
This project entails an exploration of K-Means
Clustering, an Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm.
The project is split into four components:
- An implementation of K-Means.
- A write-up on a research paper that I found interesting
on estimating the value of K.
- A write-up on the performance of my K-Means implementation.
- An implementation of the Elbow Method to better the performance
of my algorithm.
- Tested several sample K-Means problems on my implementation, 
in the Main function.
